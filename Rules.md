b. To avoid conflicts of interest, a member of the chat room may be asked to replace a moderator directly involved in the situation.
c. The ban reason will be sent as a public message after the action is taken. 
d. Any member may be given an opportunity to refute a ban upon request. Said member would be invited to present their argument in the private moderator chat.
e. If at least 3 moderators are not available for a vote, the person in question shall be removed until a decision is made. Once the decision is made, they will either be banned and informed of their ban or added back to the chat.
